# These examples go with the Learning Cards for the Rainbow HAT

The learning cards are available as physical cards from shop.pimoroni.com, or as online tutorials at edu.pimoroni.com/rainbowhat

They are meant to be self-led learning, with ideas and suggestions for extensions and debugging on each card.
